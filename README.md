.## Meltwater | React Technical Exercise

A simple to-do list has been started. Let's make it work. 
* Use React hooks for this exercise and take advantage of using custom hooks where applicable.

### Steps
1. Import the list from data.json and display them in the ToDoList component.
2. Create a toggle method by clicking on an individual list item to show they are complete (css styling may be required).
3. Add a handleFilter method to remove all tasks marked as completed when the user clicks on "Clear Completed" button.
4. Create an addTask method allowing the user to add items to the list.
5. Add a reset button to pull in the original list.
6. Let's clean up the file to break the components out into their own files. Do you see a spot where a React hook would be useful?
